# R-Package
This R package offers a comprehensive suite of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques for both binary and continuous response variables. It supports a wide range of predictor types, including continuous, discrete, and binary variables, and is designed to handle high-dimensional data scenarios where the number of predictors can be much larger than the sample size.

Features
Model Implementation
The package implements the following models:

Linear Regression:

Fits a linear regression model to the data.
Supports continuous response variables.
Logistic Regression:

Fits a logistic regression model for binary response variables.
Ridge Regression:

Performs ridge regression, a form of regularized linear regression, for both binary and continuous response variables.
Introduces a penalty term to shrink the coefficients towards zero, improving model stability and reducing overfitting.
LASSO Regression:

Implements the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, another type of regularized linear regression, for binary and continuous response variables.
Applies an L1 penalty, forcing some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection.
Elastic Net Regression:

Combines the penalties of ridge and LASSO regression, allowing for efficient variable selection and shrinkage of coefficients.
Suitable for scenarios where there are many correlated predictors.
Random Forest:

Implements the random forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks.
Can handle binary or continuous response variables.
Can handle a mix of continuous, discrete, and binary predictors.
Data Handling
When the number of predictors is much larger than the sample size (p >> n), the package offers an option to pre-screen for the top K most "informative" predictors to be included in the model. The package tutorial page provides a detailed description of how these informative predictors are chosen, including the criteria and methods used for predictor selection.

Bagging
To improve model robustness, the package provides an option to perform bagging (bootstrap aggregating) for linear, logistic, ridge, LASSO, and elastic net models. The final predicted values are obtained by averaging the bagged models, with the averaging method described in the package tutorial.

The bagging process works as follows:

The original dataset is resampled with replacement multiple times (e.g., 100 times), creating bootstrap samples.
For each bootstrap sample, the chosen model (e.g., Ridge regression, Lasso regression, etc.) is fitted.
The final predicted values are calculated as the average of the predictions from all the fitted models.
Additionally, a "naive" variable importance score is calculated, which counts the number of times each variable is selected in the bagging process. This score provides an estimate of the relative importance of each predictor in the model.

Ensemble Learning
Users can choose to perform ensemble learning by fitting multiple models on the same dataset (e.g., glmnet and random forest). The package combines the results from different models using a specified method, with details provided in the package tutorial.

The ensemble learning process works as follows:

Users specify if they want to run a default model or want to customise the model.
If the users chose to customise the model, they specify the types of models they want to fit (e.g., LASSO regression and random forest), and their corresponding proportions(e.g., 0.3,0.7)
Each chosen model is fitted on the same dataset.
The final predicted values are obtained by combining the predictions from all the fitted models according to the proportions specified by the user.
Dependencies
The package relies on the following external R packages:

glmnet: For ridge, LASSO, and elastic net regression models.
randomForest: For random forest models.
MASS: For in-built datasets to test the models.
No other external packages are used, and the package utilizes functions from the base R package for certain tasks.
